/// @class AudioKaraoke
/// @brief Syllable split and join UI for karaoke
///
/// This class has two main responsibilities: the syllable split/join UI, and
/// the karaoke mode controller. The split/join UI consists of the dialogue
/// line with spaces and lines at each syllable split point. Clicking on a line
/// removes that \k tag; clicking anywhere else inserts a new \k tag with
/// interpolated duration. Added or removed splits are not autocommitted and
/// must be explicitly accepted or rejected. This is for two reasons:
///   1. It's easy for a stray click on the split/join bar to go unnoticed,
///      making autocommitting somewhat error-prone.
///   2. When a line with zero \k tags is activated, it's automatically split
///      at each space. This clearly should not automatically update the line
///      (changing the active selection should never directly change the file
///      itself), so there must be a notion of pending splits.
///
/// As the karaoke controller, it owns the AssKaraoke instance shared by this
/// class and the karaoke timing controller, and is responsible for switching
/// between timing controllers when entering and leaving karaoke mode. Ideally
/// the creation of the dialogue timing controller should probably be done
/// elsewhere, but there currently isn't any particularly appropriate place and
/// it's not worth caring about. The KaraokeController duties should perhaps be
/// split off into its own class, but at the moment they're insignificant
/// enough that it's not worth it.
///
/// The shared AssKaraoke instance is primarily to improve the handling of
/// pending splits. When a split is added removed, or a line is autosplit,
/// the audio display immediately reflects the changes, but the file is not
/// actually updated until the line is committed (which if auto-commit timing
/// changes is on, will happen as soon as the user adjusts the timing of the
/// new syllable).
