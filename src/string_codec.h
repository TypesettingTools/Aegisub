/// @file string_codec.h
/// @see string_codec.cpp
/// @ingroup utility
///
/// Functions for "inline string encoding" handling,
/// a simple encoding-form used for encoding strings that can't contain control codes and a few other special characters,
/// so they can be stored as part of a field in an ASS line
///
/// Even though the encoding will handle Unicode strings, it can only encode ASCII characters.
/// This is not a problem, since only ASCII characters are used for the special purposes.
///
/// The encoding is based on an escape-character followed by a two-digit hexadecimal number, the number being the
/// ASCII code for the encoded character. The escape character is # (ASCII 0x23).
///
/// @verbatim
/// The following ASCII codes must be escaped:
/// 0x00 .. 0x1F -- Control codes (nonprintable characters, including linebreaks)
///         0x23 -- Sharp (the escape character itself must be escaped to appear in the literal)
///         0x2C -- Comma (used for field separator in standard ASS lines)
///         0x3A -- Colon (used in some custom list formats for name:value pairs)
///         0x7C -- Pipe (used in some custom lists, as item separator, e.g. itemA|itemB)
/// @endverbatim
///
/// The encoded string should be usable in any kind of field in an ASS file.
