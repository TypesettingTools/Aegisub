Changes
1.1
 Skip indexing for avi
 Prefix all error messages with the plugin name
 Can write v2 timecodes to a file
 Fixed reported framerate

Usage
FFmpegSource(string source, int track = -1, bool forceseek = false, string timecodes = "")
source: source file
track: video track nubmer as seen by the relevant demuxer, must be a video track
       negative values means the first found video track
forceseek: seek even if the format has no registered index, only useful for containers with limited avformat support
timecodes: file to output timecodes to, implies indexing the file no matter what type

Compatibility
AVI, MKV, MP4: Frame accurate
OGM: Messed up first frame and seeking produces smearing with forceseek=true, incredibly slow seeking without
WMV: No seeking
VOB: No rff flags, otherwise it appears to work
TS: Seeking goes way off, number of total frames is probably off too
