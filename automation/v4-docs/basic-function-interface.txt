Automation 4 Basic Interface

This document described the basic functions needed to define an Automation 4
script. This covers Feature registration and the prototypes of functions used
to implement the various features.

---

Macro Registation Function

This is a function called from top-level of an Automation script to register
a new Macro Feature.

function aegisub.register_macro(
    name,
    description,
    processing_function,
    validation_function)

@name (string)
  The displayed name of the menu item this macro will generate.

@description (string)
  A longer description of the function of this macro. This will appear
  on the status bar when hovering over the menu item.

@processing_function (function)
  The actual function called for the macro execution.
  This function must be an instance of the Macro Processing Function
  described below.

@validation_function (function)
  Optional. A function called when it is to be determined whether the
  macro can act on the current subtitles.
  This function, if provided, must execute very quickly to avoid lag
  in the GUI.
  This function must be an instance of the Macro Validation Function
  described below.

Returns: nothing.

---

Filter Registration Function

This is a function called from top level of an Automation script to register
a new Export Filter Feature.

function aegisub.register_filter(
    name,
    description,
    priority,
    processing_function,
    options_window_provider)

@name (string)
  The name of the filter, as presented to the user.

@description (string)
  A longer description of the filter presented to the user.

@priority (number)
  A number determining the default order the enabled filters will be
  processed. The order can be overridden by the user.
  Priorities of some built-in filters:
   o Clean Script Info = 0
   o Fix Styles = -5000
   o Transform Framerate = 1000
  Filters with higher priority will be executed earlier by default.

@processing_function (function)
  The function called to do the actual filter processing.
  This function must be an instance of the Filter Processing Function
  described below.

@options_window_provider (function)
  Optional. A function providing a dialog template for setting options
  prior to filter processing.
  This function must be an instance of the Filter Options Window Provider
  function described below.

Returns: nothing.

Format Reader Registration

This is a function called from top level in an Automation script to register
a new File Format Reader Feature.

function aegisub.register_reader(
    name,
    extension,
    processing_function)

@name (string)
  The name of the file format.

@extension (string)
  The file extension usually given to this file format. This must not
  include any wildcards. (Ie. extension could be "srt", "sub", "ssa" and
  so on.)

@processing_function (function)
  The function called to do the actual file import.
  This function must be an instance of the Format Reader Function described
  below.

Returns: nothing.

---

Format Writer Registration

This is a function called from top level in an Automation script to register
a new File Format Writer Feature.

function aegisub.register_writer(
    name,
    extension,
    processing_function)

@name (string)
  Name of the file format, as presented to the user.

@extension (string)
  The usual file extension given to this file format. This is automatically
  be attached to the file name on export, unless the user chooses to
  override it.

@processing_function (function)
  The function doing the actual file export.
  This function must be an instance of the Format Writer Function described
  below.

Returns: nothing.

---

Macro Processing Function

This function is called by Aegisub to execute a macro.

function process_macro(
    subtitles,
    selected_lines,
    active_line)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
process_macro.)

@subtitles (user data)
  A Subtitles Object, that can be used to retrieve information about the
  subtitle file the macro is being applied on.

@selected_lines (table)
  An Array Table of numbers, each entry being an index into the file
  represented by @subtitles. Each of the entries in this table describe that
  a line is marked as selected by the user.

@active_line (number)
  Index of the currently active line in the subtitle file.

Returns: nothing.

---

Macro Validation Function

This function is called by Aegisub to determine whether a macro can be applied
to the current state of the subtitles and selection.

This function needs to execute very fast, since it may be called for several
macros whenever a menu is opened. It is suggested not to use @subtitles at all
in this function.

This function does not have to be defined. If it's undefined, it's taken as if
it always returned true.

function validate_macro(
    subtitles,
    selected_lines,
    active_line)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
validate_macro.)

@subtitles (user data)
  A Subtitles Object, that can be used to retrieve information about the
  subtitle file the macro is to be be applied on.

@selected_lines (table)
  An Array Table of numbers, each entry being an index into the file
  represented by @subtitles. Each of the entries in this table describe that
  a line is marked as selected by the user.

@active_line (number)
  Index of the currently active line in the subtitle file.

Returns: Boolean.
  true is the macro can be applied to the current state of the subtitles,
  false if not.

---

Filter Processing Function

This function is called by Aegisub to filter the subtitles during an export
operation.

function process_filter(
    subtitles,
    config)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
process_filter.)

@subtitles (user data)
  A Subtitles Object, that can be used to retrieve information about the
  subtitle file the filter is being applied on.

@config (table)
  A Dialog Result table representing the options the user selected for the
  filter before starting the export operation. The fields present in this
  table are defined by the dialog provided by the Filter Options Window
  Provider function.

Returns: nothing.

---

Filter Options Window Provider function

This function is called by Aegisub to get a Dialog Window definition to prompt
the user for input before an export operation.
The data input into the dialog returned by this function are automatically
stored into the original subtitle file when an export operation is started.

function filter_options_dialog(
    subtitles,
    stored_options)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
filter_options_dialog.)

@subtitles (user data)
  A Subtitles Object, that can be used to retrieve information about the
  subtitle file the filter is to be applied on.

@stored_options (table)
  The currently stored options for this export filter. The keys in this table
  are the option names, and the values are the values stored for those options.

Returns: A Dialog Window table.

---

Format Reader Function

This function is called by Aegisub to import a file from a foreign file
format.

function read_format(
    input_file,
    output_subs)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
read_format.)

@input_file (user data)
  An Input File Stream, representing the file selected for import.

@output_subs (user data)
  An empty Subtitles Object the imported data should be added to.

Returns: Boolean.
  True if the import succeeded, false if it failed.

---

Format Writer Function

This function is called by Aegisub to export a file to a foreign file format.

function write_format(
    input_subs,
    output_file)

The name of the function is script-defined. (It doesn't have to be
write_format.)

@input_subs (user data)
  A Subtitles Object representing the subtitles to be exported.

@output_file (user data)
  An Ouput File Stream, representing the file the exported data should be
  written to.

Returns: Boolean.
  True if the export succeeded, false if it failed.
  If this function returns false, the output file is deleted from disk.

---

Script information globals

These are a series of global variables, the script author can set. They are
purely informational, and won't have any actual influence on how the script
is treated.

None of these are required, but it is recommended to provide them.

These should never be present in include files.

script_name (string)
  A short, descriptive name for the script, used for presenting it to the
  user in the UI.

script_description (string)
  A longer description of the purpose of the script, presented to the user
  in the UI.

script_author (string)
  Name(s) of the author(s) of the script.

script_version (string)
  Version number of the script.

---

Including other scripts

For implementation reasons (and partially compatibility reasons), the Lua
built-in dofile() and loadfile() functions are removed, and a custom include()
function is provided instead.

This function behaves almost the same as dofile(), except that it doesn't
support reading from stdin (no such thing exists/is supposed to exist for
Aegisub) and it follows some special search rules along a path.

function include(filename)

@filename (string)
  The relative path to the script to include.

Returns: Any return-values of the included script.

File search rules:
1. If there are no path-components in the filename (ie. just a filename),
   the directory of the original script is searched first. Afterwards, the
   search path specified in the Aegisub configuration file is searched.
2. If the filename contains path components, it is only searched relative
   to the location of the original script file.
3. Absolute paths are not mangled in any way. Using absolute paths is
   discouraged. (Absolute paths were disallowed in Automation 3.)
