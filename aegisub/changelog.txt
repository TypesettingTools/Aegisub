= 2.00 - 2007.xx.xx ===========================

- New Aegisub logo. (AMZ)
- The Automation 4 system has been introduced. This means lots of changes. (jfs)
  o The Lua engine is now based on Lua 5.1, which means a few new language features.
  o A Ruby 1.9-based scripting engine has been added (Pomyk)
  o Legacy Automation 3 scripts are still supported and is still based on Lua 5.0 to avoid compatibility problems
    - Note that some scripts might still need minor changes to work
  o It is now possible to write macros that manipulate subtitles directly
  o Scripts have full access to the entire subtitle file, not only the "Events" section
  o Scripts are automatically reloaded when the Export dialog is opened (this can be changed in Options)
    - Ctrl or Ctrl+Shift click on the Automation toolbar button to reload autoload/all scripts
- Video mode changes:
  o It has been mostly rewriten and now uses OpenGL instead of software rendering, making it much faster on computers with video cards that don't belong to the stone age. (AMZ)
  o Optionally, it can use a Pixel Shader to convert YV12 to RGB32 in hardware, which is much faster, with a decent video card. (AMZ)
  o Video display fixed on Linux and Mac (Azzy)
  o Made the video display detachable. (AMZ)
  o Fixed Custom Aspect Ratio input. (Dansolo)
  o Added a dummy video provider to create a blank video with customizeable options. (jfs/AMZ)
  o Destination of screenshots can now be set in the options dialog. (AMZ)
  o Added support for using other renderers than VSFilter with Avisynth as video provider. (AMZ)
  o Added support for FFMpegSource in Avisynth provider if FFMpegSource.dll is on Aegisub's folder. (AMZ)
  o Added support for DirectShowSource2 in Avisynth provider if avss.dll is on Aegisub's folder. (AMZ)
  o Added support to save and load keyframe list files. (AMZ)
  o Fixed subtitles positioning removing \p tags from the line. (AMZ)
  o libass support for subtitles on all platforms. (Azzy/AMZ)
  o CSRI support for subtitles on all platforms. (equinox/AMZ)
  o Framegrabs from the video now also includes framenumber in the filename. (jfs)
  o Added a toggleable overscan mask to show which areas might get cropped by televisions. (AMZ)
- Visual Typesetting functionality implemented, which should make typesetting much easier and faster. It supports: (AMZ)
  o Dragging, including support for \move;
  o Rotation on Z axis;
  o Rotation on X/Y axes;
  o Scaling on X/Y axes;
  o Clipping to a rectangle.
- Audio mode changes:
  o Normal and SSA mode have been merged into one, all functionality available to both is now used at once. This is the same behavior as Sabbu has. (AMZ)
  o Next line on commit is now on by default. (AMZ)
  o Auto-commit will never change to the next line. (AMZ)
  o Added an option to, when dragging line start/end markers, snap to keyframes or nearby subtitle start/end markers. This behavior can always be toggled by holding down shift. (AMZ)
  o The "Play" shortcut will always play, regardless of whether it was already playing or not. There is a new shortcut for "Stop". (AMZ)
  o Styles for line start/end markers have changed. (AMZ)
  o Holding down ctrl lets you retime the original line while in Karaoke mode. (AMZ)
  o Middle click will now jump the video to the time under the mouse. (AMZ)
  o Added DirectSound audio output, to avoid using PortAudio under Win32. (AMZ)
  o Switching to a new line in audio mode now centers the line on the grid. (AMZ)
  o Flexibible audio cache names now allow you to have more than one copy of Aegisub open with audio loaded to HD cache. (AMZ)
  o Added Medusa-style (numpad) global timing shortcuts, that can be enabled with the button under the audio display. This is disabled by default. (AMZ)
  o Fixed drawing of inactive lines in audio display to prevent it from being drawn over selection. (AMZ)
  o Added options to toggle the display of the audio timeline and of the time over the mouse cursor. (AMZ)
  o Added option to disable automatic grabbing of times from selected lines on the audio display. Also, it will never pick the times from 0:00:00.00 -> 0:00:00.00 lines. (AMZ)
  o Moved karaoke syllable text in audio display to the top instead of bottom, since it often covered important information in spectrum mode (jfs)
  o Misc. changes and bugfixes in karaoke mode. Using the syllable splitter should be easier now. (jfs)
  o Fixed loading of Avisynth Scripts as audio. (AMZ)
- Changes to Audio Spectrum: (jfs)
  o The calculated FFT data are now cached, so things should be faster.
    - The maximum size of the cache can be configured. Default is unlimited, which provides the best performance assuming enough memory is available.
  o The quality of the spectrum can be easier configured, better quality requires more CPU and memory.
  o Actual signal power is now more accurately represented.
  o The palette is changed.
  o The selection is no longer shown by ugly reverse colour but with a different palette instead.
  o Use vertical zoom slider to amplify/dampen displayed signal strength. (Useful for better visualisation of quiet sections, or easier picking out the dominating frequencies in noisy sections.)
- Style Manager changes:
  o Automatically select the style of the current line when Style Manager is opened. (jfs)
  o Style storages with invalid characters are now caught, and the invalid characters replaced with safe ones. Previously such storages seemed to be created correctly but were never stored to disk. (jfs)
  o Added long-missing Edit buttons. (jfs)
  o Renaming a style will now ask you if you want to rename all instances of it on the script. (AMZ)
  o Style name collisions (when moving from storage, creating or renaming) will now prompt the user before performing the action. (AMZ)
  o Added an "Import from script..." button to import styles directly from other subtitle files. (AMZ)
  o Added buttons to move styles up, down, to top or to bottom, on both storage and current script. (AMZ)
  o Added sorting functionality for both storage and current script. (AMZ)
  o Prevent creating multiple storages with the same names. (AMZ)
- Style editor changes:
  o Prevent creating multiple styles with the same names. (AMZ)
  o New, more horizontal, layout (AMZ)
  o Realtime preview box (AMZ)
  o Editable drop-down (combo box) to select fonts, instead of the OS's standard font chooser. This allows easy realtime preview of fonts. (AMZ)
  o Alpha and margin edit boxes were replaced with spin controls. (AMZ)
  o Hitting enter will now "OK" it. (AMZ)
  o Default secondary colour is now red. (AMZ)
- Changes to subtitle reading/writing:
  o Instead of falling back to your local charset, Aegisub will now use the "universalchardet" library (the one used by the Mozilla project) to autodetect the character set of non-Unicode files. (AMZ)
  o Support reading SSA/ASS files with intermixed V4 and V4+ Styles sections. (jfs)
  o Fixed loading of sections with unexpected casing. (AMZ)
  o Added plain-text export (jfs)
  o Added support for reading ASS, SSA and SRT softsubs directly from Matroska files. (AMZ)
  o Fixed loading of SRT and TXT files, which were causing an empty line to appear at the start of the file. (AMZ)
  o Improved saving of SRT files. (AMZ)
  o Added support for reading v4.00++ (ASS2) files. (AMZ)
  o Added very basic reading support for MPEG-4 Streaming Text (TTXT) subtitles. (AMZ)
  o Added full read-write support for MicroDVD subtitles (the most common .sub format). (AMZ)
  o Added support for writing Adobe Encore subtitles, both PAL and NTSC. (AMZ)
- Changes to main menu:
  o There are now new options, and most were moved around to have better organization. (AMZ/jfs)
  o General tweaks changes, such as better icons, and fixing of flickering and slowness. (AMZ)
  o Undo and redo now have descriptions. (Dansolo)
  o Merged the three "Recombine" functions into a single one that autodetects the correct type, and also supports two new cases. (AMZ)
  o Added the associations dialogue to the menu. (AMZ)
- Subtitles grid changes:
  o Fixed line selection after pasting. (AMZ)
  o Plain-text lines can now be pasted into the grid. They will be inserted as default lines with the text as their content. (AMZ)
  o Added Paste Over function, which allows you to paste subtitle lines over others, overwriting the fields of your choice. (AMZ)
  o Scrollbar in grid didn't always allow scrolling through all the subs. (jfs)
  o Minor fix to the calculation of the grid's "Style" column width. (AMZ)
  o Layer and margin columns are no longer shown if all lines have default values for those. (AMZ)
- Subtitles edit box changes:
  o The whole layout has been tweaked. (AMZ)
  o Replaced wxTextCtrl with wxStyledTextCtrl, to solve many issues related to the Rich Text edit control. (AMZ)
  o Improved Syntax Highlighter to include more features of ASS. (AMZ)
  o Added an inline Hunspell-based Spell Checker. (AMZ)
  o Added an inline MyThes-based Thesaurus. (AMZ)

  o Layer box replaced with a spin control in the subtitles edit box. (AMZ)
  o Commiting text now commits times as well. (AMZ)
  o Changes to text will no longer be discarded when you commit timing in the audio display and vice-versa. (AMZ)
  o Added a Call Tip feature to the edit box, so it shows the function prototype as you type it. (AMZ)
  o Fixed glitches related to the Duration time edit box. (AMZ)
  o Tweaked the behavior of the margin boxes, now they no longer show padding zeros. (AMZ)
  o Actor and Effect fields now show a "ghosted" caption saying their name when they are not focused on and blank. (AMZ)
  o Added a "Commit" button that duplicates the Enter/Ctrl+Enter functionality, since those shortcuts were not obvious to everyone. (AMZ)
- Changes to Fonts Collector:
  o Changed the font searching engine to something slower, but far more reliable. (jfs/AMZ)
  o Added option to just verify if you have the fonts. (AMZ)
  o You can now collect fonts directly to a zipped archive. (AMZ)
  o Fixed behavior of the Escape key in it. (AMZ)
  o Redesigned the interface and replaced the log window with a much better Scintilla control. (AMZ)
  o You can now collect multiple times without reopening the dialog. (AMZ)
- All user-specific files (configuration, style storages, etc) are now stored on Application Data\Aegisub in Windows. (AMZ)
- config.dat can optionally be stored on the same folder as aegisub.exe. (AMZ)

= 1.10 beta - 2006.08.07 ===========================

- Always defaults to Audio Cache=1 (ram) now (Myrsloik)
- Automation: Added xor(a,b) boolean logical function to utils.lua (jfs)
- Automation: Various changes to karaskel.lua and karaskel-adv.lua: (jfs)
   o Added some debug-calls (which are disabled by default; aegisub.output_debug is replaced with a do-nothing function (you can change this in karaskel.lua)
   o The regular aegisub.output_debug is aliased to aegisub.output_warning, in order to always be able to show real warnings, in case something goes wrong
   o Fixed bug, triggered when a line had a style not defined in the subs. A warning is now shown instead.
- Fixed bug in parser that would cause Aegisub to crash if you had a \fn without parameters and tried to pick font. (AMZ)
- Fixed crash when opening audio that appeared in 1.08 (Myrsloik)
- Karaoke mode changes: (jfs)
   o New syllable-splitter: Click "split" to enable splitting-mode, click in syllable view to set split-markers, then click commit to do the splitting
   o The correct \k tag (\k, \kf, \ko, \K) is now kept when splitting/joining
   o When editing karaoke-timing for a line and not splitting/joining, all tags are kept intact, so only the \k tag timings are changed
   o Right-click in karaoke area to change the tag (\k, \kf, \ko)
   o Click and drag to select multiple syllables
- Fixed bug where \t tags (among others?) would lose their parameters when being rebuilt (happens with Framerate Transport export filter, Automation and during the karaoke timing improvements listed above, among other places) (jfs)
- Implemented FexTracker, for automatically tracking positions on the video and placing text accordingly (Tentacle)
- Drag-and-drop files onto the program no longer causes the subs to be unloaded every time, even if no subs were dropped (jfs)
- 1,1+2 recombining lines where 1 is a substring of 2 no longer causes incorrect behavior. 1+2,2 similarly fixed. This fix also gives more sanity-checking in the recombining (jfs)
- Replaced the subtitles grid with a custom control, which should hopefully behave and look better. (AMZ) Changes are:
   o Currently active line is now highlighted with a border.
   o The grid can optionally no longer receive focus (this behavior is disabled by default, change "Grid Allow Focus" to 0 in config.dat to prevent it from getting focus).
   o Fixed bug related to tag cycling, which would reset grid, move video and force a refresh of everything (slow, and could undo uncommited changes).
   o Rows colliding with the currently active one will now be highlighted in grid.
   o Selected comments are now highlighted in a different color.
   o Fixed behavior of deleting and joining lines on grid.
   o Inserted lines will now be automatically selected.
   o Alt+Click on grid will activate the clicked line, without modifying selection.
   o Actor and effect columns are now only visible if they are being used.
   o Double clicking a row will jump video to it, regardless of auto go to option.
   o Unhandled keypresses in grid will now be sent to the audio display.
- Toolbar will now properly disable the Jump To buttons if more than one line is selected. (AMZ)

- Default video zoom can now be set in config.dat and is defaulted to 100%. (AMZ)
- Fixed crash in Translation and Styling assistants, when you attempted to move past end of file, and then play. (AMZ)
- Fixed linked commit of times, so it will only commit both times if the other was changed (to prevent damage when editing multiple lines). (AMZ)
- Fixed some bugs related to inserting overrides via the buttons over the edit box. (AMZ)
- Implemented Redo (and there was much rejoicing). (AMZ)
- Fonts collector will now default collection to same folder as script (Set to "?script" on config.dat). (AMZ)
- Alt+Left/Right on the video seek bar will now seek by increments of 10 frames (increment is customizeable in config.dat). (AMZ)
- Added a simple audio resync method for video playback. (AMZ)
- Audio timing will now apply to all selected lines, as well as active line. (AMZ)
- Added a volume slider bar to audio mode. (AMZ)
- Fixed some internal workings, which should make Aegisub use considerably less RAM (especially for large Karaoke files, 8-10x less RAM usage was measured with a 9 MB file). (AMZ)
- Aegisub will now dump the stack to stack.txt when it crashes with a fatal exception, which might or might not work. (AMZ)
- Audio display in SSA mode will no longer ignore clicks if it wasn't focused (AMZ)
- The font override button in the subtitles edit box can now modify font size, italics, bold and underline as well as font face (no strikeout, as wx does not provide an interface to access that data). (AMZ)
- Now requires Avisynth 2.5.6a or later, added an option ("allow ancient avisynth") to override it to config.dat. (Myrsloik)
- Added reading of keyframe and timecode data from Matroska files (which are still not recommended, due to their dependency on DirectShowSource). (AMZ)

- Saving back to SRT directly (that is, via "save", not "export" or "save as") is now allowed, as long as no data will be lost. (AMZ)
- Aegisub now supports file attachments, which are stored decoded (to save memory) and are not part of the undo stack (for the same reason). Previously, they were simply left ignored in the file as unknown lines. (AMZ)

= 1.09 beta - 2006.01.16 ===========================

- Implemented Timing Post-Processor dialog to automatically add lead-in/lead-out, scene timing and adjascence adjustment for sharp-timed subs (AMZ)
- Aegisub is now translateable, with proper localization files. (AMZ) Available now are:
   o Brazilian Portuguese
   o French (thanks to TechNiko and Kurasu)
   o Russian (thanks to ]thrash_sensei[)
   o German (thanks to equinox)
- Fixed saving of hotkeys (AMZ)
- Fixed behavior of Insert key in Translation Assistant (AMZ)
- Ctrl+Enter now previews in translation assistant (AMZ)
- Fixed "make times continuous" bug (AMZ)
- Checks if there's enough free space when using disk cache and asks if disk cache should be used when there isn't enough ram available (Myrsloik)
- Always enforces the set memory limit for avisynth even if no video is opened (Myrsloik)
- Fixed crashes when not enough memory could be allocated for ram cache (Myrsloik)
- Properties dialog will no longer flag file as modified if nothing changed (AMZ)
- The config.dat file is now fully documented again, for the first time since beta 1.00... let's see how long it lasts. (TheFluff)
- Selected line is now properly enabled on audio display when audio is loaded (AMZ)
- Cosmetic improvements to toolbar (AMZ)
- Improved command line and drag-and-drop opening of files (extended to allow video and audio at the same time as well) (AMZ)
- Fixed audio glitches when using disk cache and scrolling the audio display while playing (Myrsloik)
- Improved the ram cache allocation so it should work for really large files if enough ram is available (Myrsloik)
- Fixed exporting of SSA styles (AMZ)
- Automation: The precalculation step in karaskel.lua is now in a function by itself, precalc_syllable_data (jfs)
- Automation: New function added to utils.lua, string.headtail(s): treats s as a list of words separated by spaces, returns two strings, the first word (the head) and the rest of the string (the tail), like car/cdr (jfs)
- Fixed behavior of dialog that asks you to change script resolution based on video resolution (AMZ)
- Video and audio displays can now be hidden via the View menu (AMZ)
- Translation assistant now shows proper text color (AMZ)
- Translation assistant now shows total line count (AMZ)
- Hotkeys for translation and styling assistants are now customizeable (AMZ)
- Default character encoding for saving can now be set via the evil "save charset" in config.dat. (AMZ) A few examples:
   o "save charset=UTF-8" - Default setting. RECOMMENDED.
   o "save charset=UTF-16" - Saves as UTF-16 instead of UTF-8. This solves issues if you must deal with a program that can't support UTF-8, such as ancient textsub or wordpad.
   o "save charset=local" - Kills unicode support in saving subtitles, and saves as local charset. THIS OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED! It will, however, make scripts compatible with Medusa and other non-unicode programs.
   o "save charset=Shift_JIS" - Same as above, but saves as Shift_JIS (japanese script). NOT RECOMMENDED!
   o "save charset=ISO-8859-1" - Same as above, but saves as ISO-8859-1 (western script). NOT RECOMMENDED!
   Remember: You can always save to another charset via the File->Export option. This is much safer!
- Setting "Use nonstandard milisecond times" in config.dat makes Aegisub use miliseconds instead of centiseconds for ASS times. DO NOT use it unless you know EXACTLY why you should! NORMAL VSFILTER CAN'T HANDLE THIS. (AMZ)
- Resolution resampler now affects drawing commands as well (AMZ)
