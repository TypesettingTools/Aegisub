## Building Aegisub

### Windows

Prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio (Community edition of any recent version is fine, needs the Windows SDK included)
2. Python 3
3. Meson
4. CMake

There are a few optional dependencies that must be installed and on your PATH:

1. msgfmt, to build the translations (installing from https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html seems to be the easiest option)
2. InnoSetup, to build the regular installer (iscc.exe on your PATH)
3. 7zip, to build the regular installer (7z.exe on your PATH)
4. Moonscript, to build the regular installer (moonc.exe on your PATH)

All other dependencies are either stored in the repository or are included as submodules.

Building:

1. Clone Aegisub's repository: `git clone https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Aegisub.git`
2. From the Visual Studio "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt", generate the build directory: `meson build -Ddefault_library=static` (if building for release, add `--buildtype=release`)
3. Build with `cd build` and `ninja`

You should now have a binary: `aegisub.exe`.

Installer:

You can generate the installer with `ninja win-installer` after a successful build. This assumes a working internet connection and installation of the optional dependencies.

You can generate the portable zip with `ninja win-portable` after a successful build.

### OS X

A vaguely recent version of Xcode and the corresponding command-line tools are required.

For personal usage, you can use pip and homebrew to install almost all of Aegisub's dependencies:

    pip3 install meson      # or brew install meson if you installed Python via brew
    brew install cmake ninja pkg-config  libass boost zlib ffms2 fftw hunspell uchardet
    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"

When compiling on Apple Silicon, replace `/usr/local` with `/opt/homebrew`.
When compiling on macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later, you may also want to `export MACOS_X_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0` to make the color picker work.

Once the dependencies are installed, build Aegisub with `meson build && meson compile -C build`.

#### Build dmg

```bash
meson build_static -Ddefault_library=static -Dbuildtype=debugoptimized -Dbuild_osx_bundle=true -Dlocal_boost=true
meson compile -C build_static
meson test -C build_static --verbose
meson compile osx-bundle -C build_static
meson compile osx-build-dmg -C build_static
```

### Linux or other

#### Build dependencies for Debian-based systems

```
compiler:    build-essential
pkgconfig:   pkg-config  or  pkgconf
meson:       meson ninja-build
gettext:     gettext intltool
fontconfig:  libfontconfig1-dev
libass:      libass-dev
boost:       libboost-chrono-dev libboost-locale-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev
zlib:        zlib1g-dev
WxWidgets:   wx3.2-headers libwxgtk3.2-dev  or  wx3.0-headers libwxgtk3.0-dev
ICU:         icu-devtools libicu-dev
pulse-audio: libpulse-dev
ALSA:        libasound2-dev
OpenAL:      libopenal-dev
ffms2:       libffms2-dev
fftw3:       libfftw3-dev
hunspell:    libhunspell-dev
uchardet:    libuchardet-dev
libcurl:     libcurl4-openssl-dev  or  libcurl4-gnutls-dev
opengl:      libgl1-mesa-dev
gtest:       libgtest-dev
gmock:       libgmock-dev
```

I.e. to install on Ubuntu 24.04 run this command:
``` bash
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config meson ninja-build gettext intltool libfontconfig1-dev libass-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-locale-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev zlib1g-dev wx3.2-headers libwxgtk3.2-dev icu-devtools libicu-dev libpulse-dev libasound2-dev libopenal-dev libffms2-dev libfftw3-dev libhunspell-dev libuchardet-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgtest-dev libgmock-dev
```

#### Build Aegisub

``` bash
meson setup build --prefix=/usr/local --buildtype=release --strip -Dsystem_luajit=false
meson compile -C build
meson install -C build
```

## Updating Moonscript

From within the Moonscript repository, run `bin/moon bin/splat.moon -l moonscript moonscript/ > bin/moonscript.lua`.
Open the newly created `bin/moonscript.lua`, and within it make the following changes:

1. Prepend the final line of the file, `package.preload["moonscript"]()`, with a `return`, producing `return package.preload["moonscript"]()`.
2. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript.base']`, remove references to `moon_loader`, `insert_loader`, and `remove_loader`. This means removing their declarations, definitions, and entries in the returned table.
3. Within the function at `package.preload['moonscript']`, remove the line `_with_0.insert_loader()`.

The file is now ready for use, to be placed in `automation/include` within the Aegisub repo.
